# Write a program to use comparission operators to compare two numbers and check whether given variable a is greater than b or not. take a = 34 and b = 80.

a = int(input("Enter a value of a: "))  # Input is converted to integer
b = int(input("Enter a value of b: "))  

# Check if a is greater than b
print("Is a greater than b?", a > b)
